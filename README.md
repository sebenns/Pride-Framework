# TSBot - Discord Botframework

**Important**: This project is due to changes in the structure of commands **outdated**. You still can re-write the core and use it with the new slash commands at ease. It's pretty simple. If you need any help, just hit me up. Otherwise have a look on the **Synergy of Serra** Discord Server, my new Wrapper Jasmine is in use there.

With the TSBot Framework you can create your own bot. Use the already existing commands and add new ones with ease
by drag'n'drop. The framework takes over the basic functionality for you and allows you to concentrate more on your own masterpiece.

### Features
